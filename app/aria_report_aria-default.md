## 1. Data Summary
- Records consolidated: 36
- RAG chunks used: 9

## 2. TRIZ Analysis
- **TECHNICAL contradiction**: revenue ↑ vs customer_satisfaction ↓  — Sales department drives revenue and deal closure, but churn rate approaches 1.0 while customer satisfaction remains <0.5.
- **PHYSICAL contradiction**: headcount ↑ vs headcount ↓  — Headcount must be high in Operations (0.875) to support service delivery AND must be low to reduce operating expenses.
- **TECHNICAL contradiction**: customer_satisfaction ↑ vs net_profit ↓  — Product department achieves highest customer satisfaction (0.69-0.77) yet generates zero revenue and consumes high operating expenses.

**Ideal Final Result:** The SaaS commercial system autonomously maximizes profitable revenue, customer lifetime value and satisfaction simultaneously, with zero churn and zero wasted cost, by aligning every department action to revenue impact in real time.

**TRIZ Principles Applied:**
- #10 Prior Action: Pre-emptively embed customer-success playbooks and upsell triggers inside the product before churn risk occurs.
- #15 Dynamism: Shift headcount dynamically between Operations, Support and Sales based on real-time customer health scores.
- #25 Self-Service: Replace manual onboarding/support tasks with in-app self-service to reduce Operations headcount while improving satisfaction.
- #35 Transformation of Properties: Convert Marketing from cost center to revenue contributor by attributing pipeline influence to campaigns and reallocating budget to high-ROI channels.

**Root Causes:**
- Lack of unified revenue attribution model across departments
- Absence of predictive churn signals feeding back to Sales and Product
- Marketing budget allocated without measurable pipeline impact
- Product roadmap disconnected from monetization levers
- Static headcount allocation not tied to customer lifecycle value

## 3. Key Findings
1. Churn rate in Sales exceeds 90th percentile of SaaS benchmarks
2. Customer acquisition cost implied by Marketing spend is unsustainable
3. Revenue per employee in Operations is 83% below benchmark
4. Product department has no revenue KPIs
